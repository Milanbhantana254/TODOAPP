# Todo-APP
I was recently fortunate to be able to participate in an intensive product design course which was generously offered by our Teacher. Through the course, I received extensive feedback from my module teacher, and I have applied that feedback to this implementation of of todo app.
Todo apps are widely used, but different users use the apps differently depending on their particular needs. In order to identify the problems faced by users of todo apps, firstly I conducted research then starting develop an understanding of the market and users needs.


We can add our todo app into the app set the time for it you will get reminder on the exact time. we can check the list as well as complete mark the list as complete once a task is been completed, delete the task if it is no required, edit it to make changes in the date, time, title etc.
An other option is the calendar and we can have an overview of all the task in a concise view.

Firstly, We can see, there will be the dashboard. At the Top of The dashboard i have set the textview name hello Milan Bhantana, task Scheduling List with the help of Textview and Recycler View. At the right side of Top, we can seen there will be the calender it will updated daily. with the help of Add Task, we can add our daily routine just filling up Add task form. the evidence is in below gif Link.

After that i will set the Notification. For example, I have added a Task for today 11:30AM. It will automatically gives us notification in Time through the alarm.

User can update and delete the task when they mistakenly entering Wrong Task through just clicking 3 dot and there will be the option of update and delete.
